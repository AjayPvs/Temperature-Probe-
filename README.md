# Temperature-Probe-
This project uses a thermocouple probe to measure meat's internal temperature on a grill, displaying it on an OLED. It provides alerts for different doneness levels. The system includes linearization of the thermocouple's non-linear response, and features a graphic UI for output and buttons for user inputs.
